Origin of the Name Hadoop:

The name Hadoop is not an acronym; it’s a made-up name. The project’s creator, Doug Cutting, explains how the name came about: 
The name my kid gave a stuffed yellow elephant. Short, relatively easy to spell and pronounce, meaningless, and not used elsewhere: 
those are my naming criteria. Kids are good at generating such. Googol is a kid’s term. Subprojects and “contrib” modules in Hadoop 
also tend to have names that are unrelated to their function, often with an elephant or other animal theme (“Pig,” for example). 
Smaller components are given more descriptive (and therefore more mundane) names. This is a good principle, 
as it means you can generally work out what something does from its name. For example, the jobtracker9 keeps track of MapReduce jobs.
